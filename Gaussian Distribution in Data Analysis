## Fun facts about Normal Distributions

Incredible number of processes in nature and social sciences naturally follows the Gaussian distribution. 
Even when they donâ€™t, the Gaussian gives the best model approximation for these processes. 

Some examples include-
1. Our height, blood pressure of adult human and intelligence
2. Position of a particle that experiences diffusion
3. Measurement errors

Some interesting facts-
1. Its mean, median and mode are all same
2. The entire distribution can be specified using just two parameters- mean and variance

According to the Empirical Rule for Normal Distribution:
-- 68.27% of data lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean
-- 95.45% of data lies within 2 standard deviations of the mean
-- 99.73% of data lies within 3 standard deviations of the mean
Thus, almost all the data lies within 3 standard deviations. This rule enables us to check for Outliers and is very helpful when determining the normality of any distribution.
