# Binomial-Gaussian-Distribution
Python Program to calculate the Binomial and Gaussian Distribution from a given file of numeric values. 

Some things that the code will do:

1. Take input in the form of a file that contains numbers
2. Calculate Mean and Standard Deviation of the given numbers

For Gaussian Distribution:
3. Calculate Probability Density Function for the distribution.
4. Plot a Histogram for the calculated PDF
5. Add two Gaussian Distributions

For Binomial Distribution:
3. Calculate 'p' and 'n' values from the input
3. Calculate Probability Density Function for the distribution.
4. Plot a Histogram for the calculated PDF
5. Add two Binomial Distributions

-- Run some unit tests on all the functions.
