## How is Binomial Distribution used in Data Analysis

One major aspect of data science is to identify patterns in the data and to predict the future scenarios based on those patterns. 
Probability distribution is all about predicting the likelihood of an event in given circumstances. 
Therefore probability distribution becomes an important tool in data science.

Binomial Distribution is a probability distribution that describes a likelihood of a value which would take place of either of the two independent values under a given set of parameters.
Many instances of binomial distributions can be found in real life. 
For example, if a new drug is introduced to cure a disease, it either cures the disease (it’s successful) or it doesn’t cure the disease (it’s a failure). 
If you purchase a lottery ticket, you’re either going to win money, or you aren’t. 
Basically, anything you can think of that can only be a success or a failure can be represented by a binomial distribution.

Binomial distributions must also meet the following three criteria:

1. The number of observations or trials is fixed. In other words, you can only figure out the probability of something happening if you do it a certain number of times. This is common sense—if you toss a coin once, your probability of getting a tails is 50%. If you toss a coin a 20 times, your probability of getting a tails is very, very close to 100%.
2. Each observation or trial is independent. In other words, none of your trials have an effect on the probability of the next trial.
3. The probability of success (tails, heads, fail or pass) is exactly the same from one trial to another.
